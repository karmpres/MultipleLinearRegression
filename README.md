# MultipleLinearRegression

This was a team project. The dataset that was used in this project is that of the population estimates for the counties of each stat in the United States of America. Our ‘Response Variable’ will be the ‘Population Estimates’. Our independent or predictor variables for this dataset are: Births, Deaths, Net migration. The Area_Name, State, nor FIPS are important for analyzing the data but are there for convenience in working with the data.

Minitab for data analysis was used in this project. In this project some of the output resulted from the minitab.
